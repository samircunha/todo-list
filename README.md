## About the project <a name="-about-project" style="text-decoration:none"></a> 

This is my first react app, to make it I was created with the create-react-app (CRA) helper and made my own modifications. It's a project that everyone who works with front-end will one day create. 

With do you can create a task, mark this task as complete and delete the task. With the main buttons, you can select completed tasks, tasks to do, delete all tasks and delete completed tasks.

To save tasks I use local storage, so if you reload the site or leave and come back later, the tasks will be there.
